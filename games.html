Here are some examples of simple games in Javascript. 
Well, technically they are not games, but you could still play with them. :-)

<br>
I thank Luc Jaouen for inspiring me to make these. I recommend checking out Luc's collections at <a href="apmr.matelys.com">apmr.matelys.com</a>.

<h2>KICK THE BALL</h2>
<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<p>Move the mouse near the ball to kick it.</p>

<h2>DAMPED MASSES </h2>
<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<p>
This is an illustration of free vibration of damped systems. A variety of systems with the damping ratios ranging from zero (undamped), between zero and one (underdamped), exactly one (critically damped), to greater than one (overdamped).
</p>
<h3>How to play: </h3>
<ul><li>Drag the masses to move them. </li>

  <li>Drag between masses to move both the adjacent masses. </li>
  <li>Drag on the sides to move all masses simultaneously. </li>
  <li>Also try swiping across the masses like you would a piano. 
  </li>
  <li>Have fun! :-)</li>
</ul>
<p>P.S. The undamped system should never stop (unless you make it to). </p>







<h3>Theory: What is damping ratio?</h3>

For every spring mass system with a mass m and stiffness k, there exists a critical value of damping given by 
[[ c_c=2*sqrt(mk)]].
 Damping ratio is the ratio of the actual damping factor c to the critical damping factor.
