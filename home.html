<h1> Hi there! </h1>

<p>
Welcome to my website! 

<br>
<br>
<br>

I am a current PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Nottingham. With a background in mechanical engineering until masters, I am  wandering across the interdisciplinary areas between mechanical engineering and computer science. 

<br>
<br>
<br>
More specifically, I would like to be good at artificial intelligence techniques (metaheuristics, hyperheuristics) and mechanical design (topology optimisation and vibroacoustics). 
<br>
<br>
<br>
I have previously worked as a Scientific Officer with the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board - Govt. of India, learning a bit of structural dynamics and seismic engineering. 
<br>
<br>
<br>

I am fascinated by science and nature. I love teaching and I aspire to become such a teacher as Richard Feynman Walter Lewin one day. 


<br>
<br>
<br>

I find joy in sharing knowledge and learning new things. If you are like me, then check out the list of concepts that fascinated me in <italic>Teaching</italic> section. You might find something interesting! If you think I need to check out something else, let me know ! :-)

Have a great day!
