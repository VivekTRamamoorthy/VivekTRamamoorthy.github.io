<h1> Hi there! </h1>


    <div >
    <p>
        I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Nottingham. 
    With a background in mechanical engineering until masters, 
    I focus on artificial intelligence techniques (metaheuristics, hyperheuristics) and mechanical design (topology optimisation and vibroacoustics).

<br>
I have previously worked as a Scientific Officer with the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board - Govt. of India, in the areas of structural dynamics and seismic engineering. 
<br>
<br>
<br>

I find joy in sharing knowledge and learning new things. 
I love teaching and I aspire to become such a teacher as Richard Feynman or Walter Lewin one day. 


<br>
<br>
<br>

I am fascinated by science and nature. 
If you are like me, then check out the list of concepts that fascinated me in <a onclick='contentUpdate("teaching.html");' href="#">Teaching</a> section. You might find something interesting! If you think I need to check out something else, let me know ! :-)

Have a great day!
