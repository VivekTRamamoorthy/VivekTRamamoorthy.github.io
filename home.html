<h1> Hi there! </h1>

<p>
Welcome to my website!

<br>
<br>
<br>

I am a current PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Nottingham. With a background in mechanical engineering until masters, I am  wandering across the interdisciplinary areas between mechanical engineering and computer science. 

<br>
<br>
<br>
More specifically, I would like to be good at artificial intelligence techniques (metaheuristics, hyperheuristics) and mechanical design (Vibroacoustics of porous materials and topology optimisation). 
<br>
<br>
<br>
I have previously worked as a Scientific officer with Atomic Energy Regulatory Board of India, learning a bit of structural dynamics and seismic engineering. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
I love science and nature fascinates me. I love teaching and I aspire to become such a teacher as Walter Lewin one day. 

<br>
<br>
<br>

Sharing knowledge and learning new things give me dopamine. If you are like me, then check out the list of concepts that fascinated me. You might find something new. :-)

If you think I need to check out something else, let me know !

Thanks for visiting and have a great day!
