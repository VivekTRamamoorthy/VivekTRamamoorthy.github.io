Hi,

I am a lecturer at the University of Hertfordshire. I work at the cross roads of mechanical engineering and computer science. My research interests are in metaheuristics, acoustics and topology optimisation. You can visit my homepage at [VivekTRamamoorthy.github.io](https://VivekTRamamoorthy.github.io).
